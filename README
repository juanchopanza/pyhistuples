This is pyhistuple, a set of python modules containing easy-to-use, pure-python classes representing histograms and NTuples. NTuples are a data structure well known in high-energy physics, where this project had its origins. It has been released within the DaVinci software project of the LHCb experiment at CERN. As far as I know, it hasn't been extensively used. See release.notes for more information.

The rationale here has been to provide intuitive and extensible classes for simple data processing and manipulation. Performance has not been a consideration so far, but it is on the to-do list. There is a simple persistency mechanism using python pickle. Among things to inversigate is the use of the shelve module for ntuples that are too large to keep in memory.

Dependencies: 

 * py.test for all unit tests.
 * matplotlib for histogram plotting.

Build:

 * There currently isn't a packaged version or build mechanism. 

Status:

 * Completely experimental.

Examples:

 * The unit tests give a good indication of how to use the different components. Documentation will follow in the not too distant future.
